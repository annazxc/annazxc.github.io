## Orienteering Game (C++ Project)
**Interactive Games with Raylib Using OOP Principles**  
This project involves the creation of an orienteering game using C++ and Raylib. It includes:
- A **presentation (PPT)**
- A **flowchart diagram**
- **Source code**
- **Documentation** generated with Doxygen in both HTML and LaTeX formats

---

## Bluetooth Controlled Car Project Final
This project uses the Dabble app to connect an HM-10 and an BT05 Bluetooth module with Arduino Mega   
to control the speed and direction of a self-built car.   
The car is powered by TT motors, driven by an L298N motor driver, for movement.   
Additionally, it features a mechanism using SG90 and MG996R servos to catch ping-pong balls.

## System of ODE’s and Phase Plane
This project models the temperature variation of cola over time using Newton's law of cooling with Matlab.  

---

## Modeling of Pandemic and Oscillator
This project discusses **ODEs** through different models:
1. **Part 1**: Analyzing U.S. pandemic data (2021) with the **Malthusian growth model** and the **Verhulst model**.
2. **Part 2**: Studying a **mass-spring-damper system** with MATLAB and Python, visualizing parameter effects and comparing their impact on **car dynamics**.

---

## Fourier Series and Transform
This project uses **MATLAB** to analyze and visualize dolphin and whale sounds, along with ocean noise. The following is done:
- Analyze and visualize the frequency spectra of these sounds
- Combine the FFT results to simulate the **acoustic effects** of dolphin and whale sounds together.

## Biomimicry Design Inspired by Scorpions
This project aims to address challenges such as typhoons and earthquakes through innovative design, incorporating considerations for:

- **Market strategy**
- **Financial planning**
- **Sustainable growth**  

---

## LEGO Group
In this project, four-link mechanisms are simulated using LEGO parts. The project explores:
- **Universal joints**
- Efficient **power input designs**

---

## NNfirst.ipynb
Built a **neural network** with four hidden layers to recognize digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is tested on both:
- A separate part of the dataset
- My own handwriting to determine which model performs best in terms of:
  1. **Accuracy**
  2. **Resource consumption**
  3. **Training time**
  
You can also directly view the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HowV9ni0lMTnJy9WerZsJyQjUspaMsKy?usp=sharing).  
Additionally, Gradio was used to present the results, and the impact of **depth** (number of layers) and **width** (neurons per layer) on the final outcome was explored.
